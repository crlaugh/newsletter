The American Modelica Conference 2018 will be held at the Samberg Conference Center in Cambridge/Boston, MA, USA from **October 9 - 10, 2018**. It is organized by the Modelica Association and the North American Modelica Users’ Group (NAMUG).

Registration is already open, with early bird discounts available until August 20th at [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-american-modelica-conference-2018-tickets-39188362447).

This will be the first full Modelica conference to take place in the Americas, and will meet the high standards established by the international Modelica conferences.  Users, library developers, tool vendors, and researchers will have opportunities to share their knowledge and learn about the latest scientific and industrial progress related to the Modelica modeling language and the Functional Mockup Interface (FMI).  The call for papers resulted in over 40 submissions, which are presently being reviewed by members of the Program Committee and will result in two tracks of presentations.  In addition, the conference will also include one track of industrial user-oriented presentations like those found at typical NAMUG events over the last 5 years that are not accompanied by a full scientific paper. The abstracts for these presentations will also be peer-reviewed by the conference board.

An entertaining social program is also being planned for the conference, with a dinner cruise around Boston harbor planned for the end of the conference's first day.  This cruise will provide excellent views of Boston landmarks, including the Seaport District and historic ships in harbor, and will provide attendees with an opportunity to socialize and unwind in a picturesque setting.

#### Free Workshops October 8th

Thanks to the generous support from MERL (Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories), NAMUG will organize two **free Modelica workshops, Monday, October 8th** (before the conference). These workshops will take place at the MERL offices in Cambridge. If you are interested in attending one of these workshops, please select “Workshop Ticket” on the Eventbrite event page. There will be a beginner’s workshop in the morning, and an advanced workshop with an introduction to modeling of thermo-fluid systems using applications from the Buildings Library in the afternoon. To aid in planning, please register soon for these workshops since these workshops are conditional on interest and participation.

We are looking forward to seeing you in Cambridge, MA.

*Dr. Michael Tiller* and Associate Professor *Luigi Vanfretti*, PhD, General Chair (Xogeny) and Program Chair (Rensselaer Polytechnical Institute)
